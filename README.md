# TaskList
TaskList is a Full Stack Web App that allows users to login and create tasks for their company to complete. When a user logs in, they will assign themselves into one of three 
departments(IT, Maintenance, or Management). It is only possible to resolve a task if they belong to the assigned department. Java will email the user when they create
a task and when a task is completed.
